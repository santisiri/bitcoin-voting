## Simple and secure voting system with Bitcoin

A schema designed to utilize Bitcoin cryptocurrency for secure and simple electronic voting. In the heart of the schema lies the [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Block_chain), so all the processes of the system are open to public audition.

#### Requirements:

* All actors of the election should be able to have a Bitcoin account.
* All actors of the election should be able to secure their voting computer.

#### Actors:

* Election Authority
* Candidate
* Voter

#### Terminology:

* Block Chain: Bitcoin public transaction list
* 0.00000001 Bitcoin: the smallest unit of Bitcoin
* BTC: Abbreviation for Bitcoin currency

#### Schema:

0. **Election Authority declaration:**
 - Election Authority publicly announces its Bitcoin address.

1. **Voter registration:**
 - Voters show a valid ID and provide their Bitcoin address to Election Authority, who sends them 0.00000001 BTC in return.
 - All voter Bitcoin addresses are publicly listed in the Blockchain.
 - To carry out citizens' right to vote anonymously, the Election Authority keeps the IDs to prevent double registration but does not keep a record of association between the IDs and the provided Bitcoin addresses.

2. **Candidate registration:**
 - Candidates provide a valid ID and their Bitcoin address to Election Authority, who sends them 0.00000002 BTC in return.
 - All Candidate Bitcoin addresses are publicly listed in the Blockchain.
 - As opposed to Voter registration, Election Authority stores and publicly announces a record of association between each candidate ID and their provided Bitcoin address.
 - Candidates are obliged to announce their Bitcoin addresses.

3. **Starting the election:**
 - Election starts when Election Authority sends 0.00000001 BTC to all the Voters' Bitcoin addresses publicly listed in the Blockchain.

4. **Voting:**
 - Voters send 0.00000001 BTC to their preferred candidate's Bitcoin addresses publicly listed in the Blockchain.

5. **Ending the election:**
 - Election ends when all voting transactions are processed for each candidate in the Blockchain.
 - If time limit is put in place, Election Authority must declare the election start and end date and time.
 - If this is a time limited election, any vote before the start datetime and after end datetime is considered invalid.

6. **Election result:**
 - Election result is obtained by counting all valid voting transactions from the registered voting addresses to the registered candidate addresses in the Blockchain.
 - Any other transaction after the first 0.00000001 BTC transaction from the Voter to the Candidate is considered disqualified.
 - The whole process from the registrations to the voting and counting the results is open to audition by anyone.
